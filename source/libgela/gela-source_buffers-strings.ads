--  Purpose:
--  Take string as source buffer.

package Gela.Source_Buffers.Strings is
   pragma Preelaborate;

   type Source_Buffer is new Source_Buffers.Source_Buffer with private;

   function Buffer_Start (Object : Source_Buffer) return Cursor;

   procedure Initialize
     (Object : in out Source_Buffer;
      Text   : in     String);

   procedure Clear (Object : in out Source_Buffer);

private

   type String_Buffer is array (Positive range <>) of aliased Character;

   type String_Access is access all String_Buffer;
   pragma Controlled (String_Access);

   type Source_Buffer is new Source_Buffers.Source_Buffer with record
