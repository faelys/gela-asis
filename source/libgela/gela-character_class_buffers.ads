--  Purpose:
--  Buffers from this package holds class for each character from source
--  buffer. Special character class (End_Of_Buffer) signals buffer is
--  empty.

package Gela.Character_Class_Buffers is
   pragma Pure;

   type Character_Class is mod 256;
   for Character_Class'Size use 8;

   End_Of_Buffer : constant Character_Class;

   type Character_Class_Buffer is limited private;

   procedure Put
     (Object : in out Character_Class_Buffer;
      Item   : in     Character_Class;
      Full   : in out Boolean);

   procedure Get
     (Object : in out Character_Class_Buffer;
      Item   :    out Character_Class);

   procedure Mark         (Object : in out Character_Class_Buffer);
   procedure Back_To_Mark (Object : in out Character_Class_Buffer);

private

   type Array_Index is mod 4096;

   type Character_Class_Array is array (Array_Index) of Character_Class;

   End_Of_Buffer : constant Character_Class := 0;

   type Character_Class_Buffer is record
      --  Index points to last read character
      Index : Array_Index := Array_Index'Last;
      --  Free points to where next Put will place an item
      Free  : Array_Index := 0;
      Mark  : Array_Index := 0;
      Data  : Character_Class_Array := (Array_Index => End_Of_Buffer);
   end record;

   pragma Inline (Put);
   pragma Inline (Get);
   pragma Inline (Mark);
   pragma Inline (Back_To_Mark);
end Gela.Character_Class_Buffers;
