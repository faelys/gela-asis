--  Purpose:
--  Abstract interface to source text buffers.
--
--  Such buffer contains source represented as array of code units.
--  Direct pointer (cursor) to code units provided to speed access up.
--  User is responsible to watch pointer stay in buffer boundaries.
--  Special code unit value (End_Of_File) is returned when end of
--  source buffer is reached.

package Gela.Source_Buffers is
   pragma Preelaborate;

   type Cursor is private;

   type Source_Buffer is abstract tagged private;

   function Buffer_Start (Object : Source_Buffer) return Cursor is abstract;

   subtype Code_Unit is Character;

   function Element (Object : Cursor) return Code_Unit;

   procedure Next (Object : in out Cursor);

   function "-" (Left, Right : Cursor) return Integer;

   End_Of_File : constant Code_Unit;

   Use_Error  : exception;

   pragma Inline (Next);

   End_Of_File : constant Code_Unit := Code_Unit'Val (0);

   type Code_Unit_Array is array (Positive range <>) of aliased Code_Unit;

   package Pointers is new Interfaces.C.Pointers
     (Index              => Positive,
      Element            => Code_Unit,
      Element_Array      => Code_Unit_Array,
      Default_Terminator => End_Of_File);

   type Cursor is new Pointers.Pointer;

   type Source_Buffer is abstract tagged null record;
