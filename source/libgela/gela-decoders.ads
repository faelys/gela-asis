--  Purpose:
--  Decoder convert part of source buffer from particular encoding to
--  plain Wide_String. Here is abstract interface to decoders.

with Gela.Source_Buffers;

package Gela.Decoders is
   pragma Preelaborate;

   type Decoder is abstract tagged limited null record;

   procedure Decode
     (Object : in     Decoder;
      From   : in     Source_Buffers.Cursor;
      To     : in     Source_Buffers.Cursor;
      Result :    out Wide_String;
      Last   :    out Natural) is abstract;
   --  Decode piece of source buffer from From till (not including) To

   type Decoder_Access is access constant Decoder'Class;

end Gela.Decoders;
